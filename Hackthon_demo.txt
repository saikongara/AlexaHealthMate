Greetings !!

The Technologies we used are:
    Amazon development portal
    Python programming (flask)
    Zappa (for deployment)

Initially we choose:
      AWS lambda function instead of Zappa,
          faced difficulty with flask_ask integration
      Later on tried running code locally and used ngrok to get a https URL
          but connection was not stable

There are couple of steps that we followed;

Step 1: Created a virtual environment locally and installed all the required dependencies.
Step 2: Created Lambda function locally in pyCharm using flask api of python.
Step 3: Created IAM account in AWS and deployed code using Zappa user which provides a static URL
Step 4: Then opened a free tier Amazon developer account and created a Alexa skill in it
Step 5: There we provided the intentSchema as a JSON file to the Skill and built it.
Step 6: Later on Configured the skill with lambda function using Zappa provided URL.

The device is now ready to test using echosim.io virtually or using devices like Echo, Echo dot physically
          by logging in with same amazon account user id and password

Now let me walk you through the code real quick;

Code demo

This code is available on gitHub

We thought of implementing scikit library to teach our skill more, but we have a very less time window to fit everything.
